# Pre-Built Prompt Repository

This folder includes firstly, the core prompts for `input.prowl`, `intent.prowl` and `output.prowl` as well as a very special prompt known by the same name as the language, `prowl.prowl`.  The rest of the prompts are organized into folders which categorize what those prompt types do. As more updates happen, and perhaps from community contribution, this will grow, giving you more out-of-the-box prompting solutions, or blocks that you can stack anyway you want with `ProwlStack`.

You can try any of these prompts out on our colab or on prowl.github.io

To see examples of using some of these check out the examples folder or see the ProwlStack documentation.
