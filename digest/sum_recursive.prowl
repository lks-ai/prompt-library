# Aggregate Summarization
Write the Cliff's Notes for the following:

## Current Summary
This is the current summary:
```
{summary}
```

## New Information
```
{text}
```

## Refactor the Summary:
Using the current summary and the new information, write a brief and concise refactored summary that integrates both and reduces the overall summary length and avoids repetition. Structure your summary correctly with markdown headers, lists and tables:
```
{summary(748, 0.0)}

```
