# Code Refinement

## Step 1: Production Readiness
Take the following code and critically analyze what it needs to be production ready. Assume that any referenced variables and libraries are available and this code is functional:
```{language}
{code}
```
### Getting it production ready
Write a numbered list of up to three considerations that could make the code above production ready:
{missing(500, 0.1)}

### Efficiency
Write a shorter numbered list of the code changes necessary to perform the above considerations. Keep in mind that some of the changes might affect the functionality of others:
{efficient_updates(300, 0.2)}

### Rewrite the code:
rewrite the code using the analysis from above, be sure to try to keep code clean and succinct
```{language}
{production_rewrite(6096, 0.0)}

```
